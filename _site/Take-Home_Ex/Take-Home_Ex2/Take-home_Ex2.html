<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pros">Pros :</h3>
<p>Clear Concept</p>
<p>It’s immediately evident that the size of the bubbles represents the magnitude of total trade (imports + exports) with each partner. This helps the audience see, at a glance, which partners have larger or smaller trade volumes. Simple Axes</p>
<p>Having Imports on the y-axis and Exports on the x-axis is a straightforward approach to show which side is higher. If a point is above the diagonal, it suggests more imports than exports, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Use of Color Regions The use of a blue vs.&nbsp;green background to highlight whether Singapore has a trade surplus (blue region) or deficit (green region) with a partner is intuitive.</p>
</section>
<section id="cons" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cons">Cons :</h3>
<p>1.Color and Contrast</p>
<p>The green vs.&nbsp;blue background is helpful, but be mindful that some viewers with color vision deficiencies might have difficulty distinguishing certain colors. Also, the bubble colors themselves could be more distinctive or correspond to a category (e.g., region or continent).</p>
<p>2.No Reference Diagonal</p>
<p>A diagonal line (y = x) could be added to highlight the balance point where imports = exports. Right now, the color change is a background region shift, but an explicit line could help viewers see precisely where net trade is balanced.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pros-1">Pros :</h3>
<p>Clear Yearly Comparison – The horizontal bars make it easy to compare exports, imports, and total trade across years.</p>
<p>Good Use of Colors – Each year has a distinct color, improving readability. Summarized Trade Total – The total trade value for each year is highlighted separately, providing quick insights.</p>
<p>Growth Indicator – The 6.6% increase in 2024 is clearly displayed, giving context to the trend. Consistent Unit Format – Using “S$ Billion” keeps the numbers digestible and avoids unnecessary complexity.</p>
</section>
<section id="cons-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cons-1">Cons</h3>
<p>No Monthly or Regional Breakdown – The data is only annual, missing trends within each year.</p>
<p>Lack of Interactivity – Users cannot hover to see exact figures or filter by specific regions. Not Easily Scalable – Adding more years could make the visualization cluttered.</p>
<p>Imports and Exports Are Hard to Compare – Placing them separately makes it harder to compare trends across the years.</p>

<p>This graph is more interactive and better to visualize all 3, which includes re -exports,imports and domestic export. In this graph we can compare the different value across years more easily.</p>

<section id="pros-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pros-2">Pros :</h3>
<p>Visually Appealing – The infographic uses a ship metaphor to represent exports, making it engaging. Easy to Understand – Clear color-coded sections and icons help differentiate categories. Provides a High-Level Overview – It summarizes export categories well, showing relative contributions. Good Use of Space – The labels and callouts are well-placed, reducing clutter.</p>
</section>
<section id="cons-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cons-2">Cons :</h3>
<p>Lack of Granularity – Some categories, like “Chemicals &amp; Chemical Products” and “Machinery &amp; Transport Equipment,” are broad; a more detailed breakdown (e.g., Pharmaceuticals, Petrochemicals, Telecommunications Equipment) would be useful. No Comparisons or Trends – It only presents absolute values without showing growth or decline</p>

<p>Yearly Comparisons: Imports in 2022 (purple) are significantly higher than in previous years. Asia has the highest import values, followed by America and Europe. Seasonality Differences: The shape of the lines suggests that imports peak during certain months and dip in others. Asia shows stronger seasonality effects compared to America and Europe.</p>

<p>Key Takeways ;</p>
<p>General Trend: Imports across all continents are increasing over time.</p>
<p>Monthly Patterns: Each panel represents a month, showing how imports behave cyclically. The blue horizontal line represents the average for that month.</p>
<p>Key Observations:</p>
<p>Imports in Asia and Europe are significantly higher compared to Africa and Australia.</p>
<p>Seasonal fluctuations appear more prominent in some continents, like Asia. There are visible peaks in specific months, potentially due to trade cycles, global events, or policy changes.</p>

<p>Key Takeways :</p>
<p>Trend Component: The overall trend shows a steady increase in imports over time, with a noticeable dip around 2010 and a sharp rise after 2020.</p>
<p>Seasonality Component: There is a strong yearly cyclic pattern in imports, meaning certain months experience repeated increases/decreases.</p>
<p>Remainder Component: The residuals show some variability, especially after 2015, which might indicate external shocks (e.g., economic crises, policy changes).</p>
